## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

**NOTE**: personal API keys and credentials should be stored in a `.env` file in the `.secrets` directory, under the root directory of the project.

The `.env` file should be in the following format:


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/collectiveai-team/demo-omni
   ```

2. Install the lastest version of [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install make
    ```

3. Install the lastest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


### VS Code development environment
1. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. Click on the green button in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window and select the `Reopen in Container` option. Alternatively, you can run the `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
4. VS Code will automatically build the Docker images and start the containers. This may take a few minutes. Once the containers are up and running, you can start developing in the VS Code development environment.
